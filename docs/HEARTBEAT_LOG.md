# Heartbeat Log

One entry per autonomous run, newest first. Written by the company-heartbeat
skill at the end of every run.

Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Did**: what was completed this run (with branch/commit refs)
- **Verified**: build/test/review status
- **Queued**: new approvals raised or backlog items added
- **Blocked**: anything waiting on the founder
```
