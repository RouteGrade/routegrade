# Heartbeat Log

One entry per autonomous run, newest first. Written by the company-heartbeat
skill at the end of every run.

Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Did**: what was completed this run (with branch/commit refs)
- **Verified**: build/test/review status
- **Queued**: new approvals raised or backlog items added
- **Blocked**: anything waiting on the founder
```

## 2026-07-21 02:27
- **Did**: First heartbeat run. Head-of-product groomed the backlog against
  actual repo state: reconciled milestone status (code is at MVP 5, docs said
  MVP 3), produced 10 concrete items (4×P1, 4×P2, 2×P3) across
  technical-writer, director-of-data, security-engineer, head-of-product,
  staff-engineer, devops-engineer, qa-engineer, qa-lead. No code changes this
  run — grooming only, per the seeded backlog.
- **Verified**: n/a (docs-only run; no build/tests touched).
- **Queued**: 5 entries in PENDING_APPROVALS.md — most urgent: production
  grades running routes with the OSRM demo's DRIVING profile (self-host foot
  profile recommended), and production sign-in is broken until the founder
  adds the Vercel callback URL to the Supabase redirect allow-list.
- **Blocked**: MVP 6 direction (proposal being drafted as P1); all 5 approval
  entries await founder verdicts.
